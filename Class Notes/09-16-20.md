### Complexity of Value Iteration
- V<sub>*</sub>(s): O(mn<sup>2</sup>), where m is the number of actions, and n is the number of states.
- q<sub>*</sub>(s, a): O(m<sup>2</sup>n<sup>2</sup>)


## Dynamic Programming, Monte-Carlo Methods, and Temporal Differences:
Deals with the question: How do we update the value function?
